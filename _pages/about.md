Hi, I am Salman K.H, I am a fifth year PhD student in [School of Computer and Information Sciences](https://scis.uohyd.ac.in/) in [University of Hyderabad](https://uohyd.ac.in)  (Institute of Eminence) under [Prof. Chakravarthy Bhagvati.](https://scis.uohyd.ac.in/~chakcs/). I completed my M.Tech in Artificial Intelligence from  [School of Computer and Information Sciences](https://scis.uohyd.ac.in/) under [Prof. Arun K Pujari.](https://www.mahindraecolecentrale.edu.in/faculty/arun-kumar-pujari)

I am currently working in the  application of disentangled representations on document images, I am interested in Machine learing and deep neural nets and their applications on  vision and language models.
 
Always a fan of  learning from first principles and constantly trying to improve the clarity of concepts.
